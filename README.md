## The problem

Tracking progress is important because it helps people achieve their goals, in this case, their fitness goals.

However, tracking personal physical progress is such a mess (weight here, photos there, etc) and it’s hard to view and share the progress with a thorough yet easy-to-do analysis.

Because it’s only a problem for those who track for themselves (because elite althlete have their team of people tracking them), it’s targeted at casual fitness people; that’s why it avoids measuring muscle sizes, for example, because those users (like me, at least) care about how strong they are and how they look like, not the exact measurement of the muscle.
