App to log your physical state in a simple yet complete manner.

## The problem

Tracking progress is important because it helps people achieve their goals, in this case, their fitness goals.

However, tracking physical progress is such a mess (weight here, photos there, etc) and it’s hard to view and share the progress with a thorough yet easy-to-do analysis. Or you could have a well-configured spreadsheet exactly as you want, but is cumbersome for fitness tracking due to its lack of automation, poor mobile experience, limited visualization, and absence of features like reminders and easy photo tracking.

To summarize, existing solutions offer a poor experience or are too time-consuming for people who simply care how they've improved overall week after week, and not about every single detail.

## The solution

>Visual Physique Tracker (or “Rastreador Visual de Físico” in Spanish, RaViFi for short) is an app to log your physical state in a simple yet complete manner.
>
>First, you set your goal. Whether you’re fat, skinny, or simply want to continue shaping your body, you’re covered.
>
>Then, work out and periodically log your aesthetics, strength, and cardiovascular capacity, in very few input boxes. No complicated measurements are needed.
>
>Already been tracking your data in spreadsheets and your phone gallery? Don’t worry, it won’t take you more than 5 minutes to import all of that into Ravifi.
>
>Finally, you can analyze all your tracked data by making before and after comparisons, looking at charts, and getting AI insights, and seamlessly share your amazing progress with the ones you care about the most.
>
>All your data is available on all of your devices. But if you ever decide you don’t want to continue using the app, just export all your data in a zip folder - for free.
