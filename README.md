App to log your physical state in a simple yet complete manner.

## The problem

Tracking progress is important because it helps people achieve their goals, in this case, their fitness goals.

However, tracking personal physical progress is such a mess (weight here, photos there, etc) and it’s hard to view and share the progress with a thorough yet easy-to-do analysis.

Because it’s only a problem for those who track for themselves (because elite althlete have their team of people tracking them), it’s targeted at casual fitness people; that’s why it avoids measuring muscle sizes, for example, because those users (like me, at least) care about how strong they are and how they look like, not the exact measurement of the muscle.

## The solution

>Visual Physique Tracker (or “Rastreador Visual de Físico” in Spanish, RaViFi for short) is an app to log your physical state in a simple yet complete manner.
>
>First, you set your goal. Whether you’re fat, skinny, or simply want to continue shaping your body, you’re covered.
>
>Then, work out and periodically log your aesthetics, strength, and cardiovascular capacity, in very few input boxes. No complicated measurements are needed.

>
>Finally, you can analyze all your tracked data by making before and after comparisons, looking at charts, and getting AI insights, and seamlessly share your amazing progress with the ones you care about the most.
>
